/**
   A very specialized non-blocking one-place swapping buffer which communicates 
   values of type T between a producer and a consumer without consing any new 
   values or copying values. Used to couple producers and consumers that operate
   at different rates. A put always puts its value in the buffer, updating the 
   previous value. Never blocks. A get blocks until there is a value.
